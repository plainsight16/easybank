### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I really developed the use of Sass for styling websites, I really got the grasp of it. I also refined my css. Some bits were challenging but i was able to research on google to find answers.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about css grids as I had a bit of challenge using it.
Positioning in Css was challenging at times.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing cheat-sheet for flexbox and its properties with detailed explanations.
